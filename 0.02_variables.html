Variables are useful in two ways; Allows us to use same value over and over again without having to write a string or other data type over and over. Javascript variables are containers for storing data values.

In this example x, y, z are variables

var= x 115;
var= y 100;
var= z x+y;

In this example x, y, z are variables=215

var price1 = 5000;
var price2 = 175;
var total = price1-price2=4,825


Sharp variables have the form of a sharp sign (#) immediately followed by one or more digits. The number represented by the digits serves as the variable's unique identifier, but leading 0s are ignored.

Sharp variables are only in scope in the statement in which they are defined.

To create a sharp variable, simply assign an object to it in a line of code using an equal sign. You cannot assign primitives (including strings) to sharp variables. Make sure you don't put in any spaces before the equal sign though.

#1 = {};       // This doesn't do much since the sharp variable is out of scope immediately after
a = #2 = {};  // Slightly more useful since we retain a reference to the new object.

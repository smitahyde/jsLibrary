You can also do more than one single operation per case, separating them with a comma, and enclosing them in parenthesis:


var stop = false, age = 23;

age > 18 ? (
    alert('OK, you can go.'),
    location.assign('continue.html')
) : (
    stop = true,
    alert('Sorry, you are much too young!')
);

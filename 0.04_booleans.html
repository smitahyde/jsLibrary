The Boolean object is an object wrapper for a boolean value.

new Boolean([value])

The value passed as the first parameter is converted to a boolean value, if necessary. If the value is omitted or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), the object has an initial value of false. If the DOM object document.all is passed as a parameter, the new boolean object also has an initial value of false. All other values, including any object or the string "false", create an object with an initial value of true.

var x = new Boolean(false);
if (x) {
  // this code is executed
}

This behavior does not apply to Boolean primitives. For example, the condition in the following if statement evaluates to false:

var x = false;
if (x) {
  // this code is not executed
}
